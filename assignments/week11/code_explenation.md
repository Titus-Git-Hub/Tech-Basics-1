### Template for Code Reading Exercise

1. Where did you find the code and why did you choose it? (Provide the link)

link: https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce/blob/main/examples/playmus.py
why: As I plan to create a game as my final project, my intention was to choose something that could be useful, and because I can imagine integrating music into my game, I saw this code as a perfect opportunity to learn.

---

1. What does the program do? What's the general structure of the program? 

The program plays music and gives the user the ability to control it using the keyboard.

---

1. Function analysis: pick one function and analyze it in detail:

- What does this function do? 
- -> The function I chose is the main function, and it brings together the entire code.
- What are the inputs and outputs?
- -> Inputs lead to Outputs:
    'q' or 'ESCAPE' or close this window to quit
    'SPACE' to play / pause
    'r' to rewind to the beginning (restart)
    'f' to fade music out over 5 seconds
- How does it work (step by step)?
- -> 1) Size and color of the screen are adjusted.
- -> 2) The file begins loading, the user receives visual feedback, and essential settings are initialized to enable the music to play.
- -> 3) The caption is named.
- -> 4) The instructions are being printed (I haven't figured out yet why "\n" does not lead to a linebreak in my case, but I will figure it out soon).
- -> 5) The file is being played.
- -> 6) Through the different Keydown events, the code is customized for the respective inputs and outputs.
- -> 7) The music also stops playing when it finishes or when the user closes the window.

1. Takeaways: are there anything you can learn from the code? (How to structure your code, a clean solution for some function you might also need...)
- -> Definitely. I plan to use parts of this code in my final project. While some adjustments will be necessary, I’m already familiar with the basics of adding music to Python games, which will support me in the process.

1. What parts of the code were confusing or difficult at the beginning to understand?
- Were you able to understand what it is doing after your own research?
- -> Yes I was able to understand what it was doing after my own research.
- -> What helped me understand the code was first getting it to run. After that, I made adjustments wherever I could and observed what happened, gradually figuring out how everything worked.

Extra notes:
As I mentioned, I wanted to understand how the code works, so I started by copying it into my PyCharm environment. However, I encountered an error message that I couldn’t fix on my own. Therefore, I asked ChatGPT to help resolve the issue with as few changes as possible. After that, the code worked. You can find the corrected version in the folder ‘week11’, where I’ve also tried to highlight the changes that were made to get it running.
